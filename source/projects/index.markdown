# Obsolete / Mothballed

## [noodle](http://rubygems.org/gems/noodle)

Use bundler to get your .NET assembly dependencies.

Before [nuget](http://nuget.org/), etc., there was nu.
While nu was a step forward (it used rubygems to manage
.NET assemblies), it didn't deal with versioning very well.
noodle was the nu concept, with [bundler](http://gembundler.com)'s
magic.

## [OpenID + NTLM](https://github.com/spraints/openid-activedirectory)

I've made a number of false starts on this concept. This is the farthest I got.
